<h2>My top 3 Favourite Book Adaptions of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
    <li><h3>To All The Boys I've Loved Before</h3></li>
    <p>This is my favourite series. I love the story plot and how the story is potrayed.</p>
    <li><h3>My Lady Jane</h3></li>
    <p>Really cool historical fiction series. Loved the Ethians-Verities concept.</p>
    <li><h3>The Summer I have turned Pretty</h3></li>
    <p>Super beautiful adaption. A swirl of emotions that a teenager feels is potrayed so realistic.</p>
