<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Vaishnavi Somarouthu, a passionate web development enthusiast and aspiring full stack developer. Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of having my own space on the internet—a "Google page about me"—and that dream fueled my curiosity and drive to explore the world of web development.</p>
<p>Web development captivates me because it combines creativity with logic, enabling me to bring ideas to life on the screen. I love learning about how different pieces of technology interact and fit together to create seamless experiences. From crafting responsive designs to working on the backend, each layer of the development process is a chance for me to learn and push my skills further.</p>
<p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computers and Communications at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam, Amaravati Campus, AP, India, where I’m building a solid foundation in technology and programming. I’m always excited to learn more, take on new challenges, and develop creative solutions that make an impact. My goal is to continually grow and contribute to the world of web development by creating functional, beautiful, and user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
